## What problem do monads solve?

---

## What problem do monads solve?

Replacing procedural statements with sequential expressions

---

## What problem do monads solve?

Foreground vs Background

---

## What problem do monads solve?

![Foreground vs Background](./foreground-background.jpg)

---

## What problem do monads solve?

Foreground = "do notation" syntax

---

## What problem do monads solve?

Background = "`bind` implementation"

---

## What problem do monads solve?

Foreground = sequential computation

---

## What problem do monads solve?

Background = boilerplate-y boxing and unboxing

---

## Common Monadic Types

- `Either error _`
- `Function input _`
- `state -> Tuple _ state`
- `Effect _`

---

## A Monadic Type Example: `Identity _`

---

## A Monadic Type Example: `Either error _`

---

## A Monadic Type Example: `inputArg -> _`

---

## A Monadic Type Example: `state -> Tuple _ state`

---

## A Monadic Type Example: `Effect _`

---

## What problem do monads solve?

---

## What problem do monads solve?

Via "do notation," monads provide a **syntax** for running "computations" in a sequential order.

---

## What problem do monads solve?

Replace statements...

```
foo();
const bar = baz();
return true;
```

---

## What problem do monads solve?

... with expressions

```
foo
bar <- baz
pure true
```

---

## What problem do monads NOT solve?


---

## What problem do monads NOT solve?

```
try {
  throw new Error("My bad!");
  console.log("I never get printed! ðŸ˜­");
} catch (e) {
  console.log("Something went wrong...");
}
```

---

## What problem do monads NOT solve?

```
const x = "Hello World!";
const f = function () {
  console.log(x);
};
f();
```

---

## What problem do monads NOT solve?

```
let x = 1;
x += 1;
x = 5;
```

---

How do we implement these features?

## How do monad transformers solve these problems?

---

## How do monad transformers solve these problems?

By **simulating** these "effects"

---

## Why use monad transformers?

---

## Why use monad transformers?

- Add such "effects" to sequential computations

---

## Why use monad transformers?

- Add such "effects" to sequential computations
- Write more decoupled code
